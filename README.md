# Credit Risk Assessment - Probability of Default (PD) Prediction

This project is a **credit risk assessment model** that predicts the **Probability of Default (PD)** of loan applicants using a **Logistic Regression** model. It is designed to demonstrate skills in **data science, financial risk modeling, and Python programming**, and can be showcased on GitHub/Resume.

## 📌 Project Overview
Credit risk assessment is a critical task in financial institutions to evaluate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their loan.  
In this project:
- **Input**: Borrower attributes (e.g., age, income, loan amount, credit history).  
- **Output**: Probability of Default (PD) → value between `0` (low risk) and `1` (high risk).  

We use:
- Logistic Regression (baseline credit scoring model).  
- Python for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
